CAR PRICES PREDICTION

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the selling price of used cars based on various features such as car model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more. Using machine learning techniques, the model helps estimate fair market prices, enabling buyers and sellers to make informed decisions.

Objectives
Load and explore the used cars dataset to understand feature distributions and relationships.
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key factors influencing car prices
Build and compare regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) for price prediction.
Evaluate model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Fine-tune models for better accuracy and interpretability.
Visualize insights and prediction results through graphs and plots.

Key Features
Data preprocessing including outlier detection and feature engineering.
Implementation of multiple regression algorithms for price prediction.
Model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.
Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Well-documented code for reproducibility.
